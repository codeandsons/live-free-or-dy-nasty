Rules, Settings, Scoring, and More

## League Introduction and Integrity

### Introduction

1. This is a **Dynasty** Fantasy Football league. It requires commitment over multiple seasons. You're in it for the long haul. Players remain on the same franchise from one season to the next unless they are traded or released.
1. The commissioner of the league is [Patrick Fitzgerald](commissioner).
1. There are 12 teams.
1. Each year after the initial season, a draft is held for rookies only. See [Annual Rookie Draft](#annual-rookie-draft) for further details.
1. The league scoring is a basic Half-PPR scheme. See [Scoring](#scoring) for further details.
1. Buy-in for the league will be $50 per year. See [Buy-In and Payouts](#buy-in-and-payouts) for further details.
1. The league is hosted on the Sleeper app (<a href="https://sleeper.app/leagues/704942669167693824" target="_blank">Live Free or Dy-nasty</a>).
1. League communications will be primarily conducted over Slack (<a href="https://livefreeordynasty.slack.com/" target="_blank">Live Free or Dy-nasty</a>) or via email. Sleeper chat may be used but will not be closely monitored.
1. All rule changes will be put to a league vote hosted on Slack. See [Rule Changes](#rule-changes) for further details.

### League Integrity

1. **Non-competitive** is defined to mean when a manager submits a lineup that includes:
   1. Any player that is an NFL Free Agent (FA / NA).
   1. Any player that is Suspended (SUS).
   1. Any player that is on Injured Reserve (IR).
   1. Any player that is Out (OUT) for multiple weeks. If a player is downgraded on game day, that will be allowed. If this becomes a trend, it will be looked into as a potential issue.
   1. A lineup with empty starter slots.
   1. The intent to lose a matchup on purpose (automatically elevates to a 3rd warning).
1. A manager fielding a non-competitive lineup will receive up to 3 warnings over the course of a **calendar year**. Beginning with the 3rd warning, the following penalties will be levied in order until exhausted:
   1. Loss of upcoming year's 2nd round draft pick
   1. Loss of upcoming year's 1st round draft pick
   1. Removal from the league without refund
1. It would be nice to see all owners return year after year; however we realize that life happens, so if a manager is unable to continue, they may work with the commissioner on finding a replacement.
1. When management of a franchise changes, the new manager will keep the same players and draft picks held by the previous manager.
1. Some things that will not be tolerated are collusion, cheating, hacking, and harassment.

## Waivers and Trades

### Waivers

1. Waivers will follow the FAAB (<a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/2021/08/free-agent-acquisition-budget-faab-primer-2021-fantasy-football/" target="_blank">Free Agent Acquisition Budget</a>) bidding process.
1. Each team will receive $100 of FAAB at the start of a new league year (some time between the Super Bowl and the rookie draft).
1. Each team's FAAB will reset to $100 at the start of the regular season.
1. Trading of FAAB is allowed.
1. Managers may bid $0.
1. When waivers are processed, the manager with the highest bid wins, and their bid is deducted from their FAAB. Losing bids are not deducted.
1. In the case of a tied bid, the manager with the higher waiver priority claims the player.
1. Waiver priority is determined initially by draft order. Each acquisition drops the acquiring team to the bottom of the waiver priority.
   1. For example, team A has priority 3 and team B has priority 5. Both managers bid $5 on a player. Team A wins the claim due to higher priority and drops to position 12 and $5 is deducted from their FAAB. All teams with priority 4 and below move up one spot, so team B will now have priority 4 for the next waiver claim and their FAAB is unchanged.
1. Waivers are processed at 4am PST daily. Players who played in a given week are locked from game time until the following Tuesday evening (processed 4am Wednesday morning).
1. Players dropped from a roster will be on waivers a minimum of 1 day.

1. Trades will open back up with the transition to a new league year in Sleeper.
